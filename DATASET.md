# Worked example 

We will use a reference genome for a Multidrug Resistant E. coli O25b:H4-ST131 (EC958). 
It was previously published here: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0104400#s5

We will take the reference genome and create simulated sequenced reads, so that we have a ground truth.
